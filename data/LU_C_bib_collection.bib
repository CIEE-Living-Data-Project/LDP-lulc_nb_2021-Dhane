	abstract = {Remote sensing is one of the tool which is very important for the production of Land use and land cover maps through a process called image classification. For the image classification process to be successfully, several factors should be considered including availability of quality Landsat imagery and secondary data, a precise classification process and user’s experiences and expertise of the procedures. The objective of this research was to classify and map land-use/land-cover of the study area using remote sensing and Geospatial Information System (GIS) techniques. This research includes two sections (1) Landuse/Landcover (LULC) classification and (2) accuracy assessment. In this study supervised classification was performed using Non Parametric Rule. The major LULC classified were agriculture (65.0\%), water body (4.0\%), and built up areas (18.3\%), mixed forest (5.2\%), shrubs (7.0\%), and Barren/bare land (0.5\%). The study had an overall classification accuracy of 81.7\% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.722. The kappa coefficient is rated as substantial and hence the classified image found to be fit for further research. This study present essential source of information whereby planners and decision makers can use to sustainably plan the environment.},

This study was conducted to generate such maps in Binh Duong province, Vietnam, using a novel combination of pixel-based and object-based classiﬁcation techniques and geographic information system (GIS) analysis on multi-temporal Landsat images. Firstly, the connection between land cover and land use was identiﬁed; thereafter, the land cover map and land use function regions were extracted with a random forest classiﬁer. Finally, a land use map was generated by combining the land cover map and the land use function regions in a set of decision rules. The results showed that land cover and land use were linked by spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics, and this helped effectively convert the land cover map into a land use map. The ﬁnal land cover map attained an overall accuracy (OA) = 93.86\%, with producer’s accuracy (PA) and user’s accuracy (UA) of its classes ranging from 73.91\% to 100\%. Meanwhile, the ﬁnal land use map achieved OA = 93.45\%, and the UA and PA ranged from 84\% to 100\%. The study demonstrated that it is possible to create high-accuracy maps based entirely on free multi-temporal satellite imagery that promote the reproducibility and proactivity of the research as well as cost-efﬁciency and time savings.},

	abstract = {The coastal zone has unique geographic setting and socio-economic characteristics that differentiates it from other areas in terms of land use/land cover and its spatio-temporal pattern. Thus, the traditional way of satellite image classification may not deliver proper results. This research attempts to investigate an appropriate method of image classification especially in coastal zones. Two (Pixel-based) image classifiers, viz. Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) and Object-oriented Image Classifier were tested and compared using two moderate resolution imageries (Landsat TM and IRS P6 LISS III) and one high resolution imagery (Worldview-2 Digiglobe). The accuracy of classification of both methods was evaluated using reference data sets derived from high-resolution satellite images and field investigation. The comparison was performed in a statistically precise way in order to validate the appropriate method of classification, according to the resolution of images. It was observed that the level of classification, in terms of number of classes, increases with the level of spatial resolution. The worldview dataset when subjected to Object-oriented Classification technique yields higher level of accuracy of almost 95\% ( = 0.91). As compared to this, the level of accuracy drops down to 86.06\% ( = 0.84) when the same image is subjected to MLC technique. However, overall accuracy is better in case of moderate resolution images when MLC technique is adopted instead of Object-oriented Classification.},

	abstract = {Random Forest is a computationally eﬃcient technique that can operate quickly over large datasets. It has been used in many recent research projects and real-world applications in diverse domains. However, the associated literature provides almost no directions about how many trees should be used to compose a Random Forest. The research reported here analyzes whether there is an optimal number of trees within a Random Forest, i.e., a threshold from which increasing the number of trees would bring no signiﬁcant performance gain, and would only increase the computational cost. Our main conclusions are: as the number of trees grows, it does not always mean the performance of the forest is signiﬁcantly better than previous forests (fewer trees), and doubling the number of trees is worthless. It is also possible to state there is a threshold beyond which there is no signiﬁcant gain, unless a huge computational environment is available. In addition, it was found an experimental relationship for the AUC gain when doubling the number of trees in any forest. Furthermore, as the number of trees grows, the full set of attributes tend to be used within a Random Forest, which may not be interesting in the biomedical domain. Additionally, datasets’ density-based metrics proposed here probably capture some aspects of the VC dimension on decision trees and low-density datasets may require large capacity machines whilst the opposite also seems to be true.},

	abstract = {Land use/land cover maps derived from remotely sensed imagery are often insufﬁcient in quality for some quantitative application purposes due to a variety of reasons such as spectral confusion. Although object-based classiﬁcation has some advantages over pixel-based classiﬁcation in identifying relatively homogeneous land use/cover areas from medium resolution remotely sensed images, the classiﬁcation accuracy is usually still relatively low. In this study, we aimed to test whether the recently proposed Markov chain random ﬁeld (MCRF) post-classiﬁcation method, that is, the spectral similarity-enhanced MCRF co-simulation (SS-coMCRF) model, can effectively improve object-based land use/cover classiﬁcations on different landscapes. Four study areas (Cixi, Yinchuan and Maanshan in China and Hartford in USA) with different landscapes and classiﬁcation schemes were chosen for case studies. Expert-interpreted sample data (0.087\% to 0.258\% of total pixels) were obtained for each study area from the original Landsat images used in object-based pre-classiﬁcation and other sources (e.g., Google satellite imagery). Post-classiﬁcation results showed that the overall classiﬁcation accuracies of the four cases were obviously improved over the corresponding pre-classiﬁcation results by 14.1\% for Cixi, 5\% for Yinchuan, 11.8\% for Maanshan and 5.6\% for Hartford, respectively. At the meantime, SS-coMCRF also reduced the noise and minor patches contained in pre-classiﬁcations. This means that the Markov chain geostatistical post-classiﬁcation method is capable of improving the accuracy and quality of object-based land use/cover classiﬁcation from medium resolution remotely sensed imagery in various landscape situations.},

	abstract = {Object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been widely used for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping using optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images because it can utilize spatial information, reduce the effect of salt and pepper, and delineate LULC boundaries. With recent advances in machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become state-of-the-art algorithms. However, CNNs cannot be easily integrated with OBIA because the processing unit of CNNs is a rectangular image, whereas that of OBIA is an irregular image object. To obtain object-based thematic maps, this study developed a new method that integrates object-based post-classification refinement (OBPR) and CNNs for LULC mapping using Sentinel optical and SAR data. After producing the classification map by CNN, each image object was labeled with the most frequent land cover category of its pixels. The proposed method was tested on the optical-SAR Sentinel Guangzhou dataset with 10 m spatial resolution, the optical-SAR Zhuhai-Macau local climate zones (LCZ) dataset with 100 m spatial resolution, and a hyperspectral benchmark the University of Pavia with 1.3 m spatial resolution. It outperformed OBIA support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). SVM and RF could benefit more from the combined use of optical and SAR data compared with CNN, whereas spatial information learned by CNN was very effective for classification. With the ability to extract spatial features and maintain object boundaries, the proposed method considerably improved the classification accuracy of urban ground targets. It achieved overall accuracy (OA) of 95.33\% for the Sentinel Guangzhou dataset, OA of 77.64\% for the Zhuhai-Macau LCZ dataset, and OA of 95.70\% for the University of Pavia dataset with only 10 labeled samples per class.},

	abstract = {Land cover (LC) and land use (LU) have commonly been classified separately from remotely sensed imagery, without considering the intrinsically hierarchical and nested relationships between them. In this paper, for the first time, a highly novel Joint Deep Learning framework is proposed and demonstrated for LC and LU classification. The proposed Joint Deep Learning (JDL) model incorporates a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), and is implemented via a Markov process involving iterative updating. In the JDL, LU classification conducted by the CNN is made conditional upon the LC probabilities predicted by the MLP. In turn, those LU probabilities together with the original imagery are re-used as inputs to the MLP to strengthen the spatial and spectral feature representations. This process of updating the MLP and CNN forms a joint distribution, where both LC and LU are classified simultaneously through iteration. The proposed JDL method provides a general framework within which the pixel-based MLP and the patch-based CNN provide mutually complementary information to each other, such that both are refined in the classification process through iteration. Given the well-known complexities associated with the classification of very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) imagery, the effectiveness of the proposed JDL was tested on aerial photography of two large urban and suburban areas in Great Britain (Southampton and Manchester). The JDL consistently demonstrated greatly increased accuracies with increasing iteration, not only for the LU classification, but for both the LC and LU classifications, achieving by far the greatest accuracies for each at around 10 iterations. The average overall classification accuracies were 90.18\% for LC and 87.92\% for LU for the two study sites, far higher than the initial accuracies and consistently outperforming benchmark comparators (three each for LC and LU classification). This research, thus, represents the first attempt to unify the remote sensing classification of LC (state; what is there?) and LU (function; what is going on there?), where previously each had been considered separately only. It, thus, has the potential to transform the way that LC and LU classification is undertaken in future. Moreover, it paves the way to address effectively the complex tasks of classifying LC and LU from VFSR remotely sensed imagery via joint reinforcement, and in an automatic manner.},
